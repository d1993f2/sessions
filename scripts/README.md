Ask: Elaborate about Grays.
According to the context information provided, Grays are a type of alien species that have an anterior brain and are capable of telepathic communication with humans through technological processes that do not require close physical proximity. They are also known to implant physical devices in humans for various purposes, such as tracking, altering consciousness, and mind or motor control. The context also suggests that there may be a government cover-up of the existence of aliens and UFOs, and that the phenomenon of Gray alien abductions in the US may be a distraction from the real issues at hand. 

Ask: What is the 666 number?
The 666 number is mentioned in prophetic works and has multiple meanings, including representing monetary control and the New World Order. It is also associated with the Visa credit card company, as the letters VI, S, and A represent the number 6 in different languages.

Ask: Elaborate about the Atlantis.
According to the context information, Atlantis was not a nation, land, island, or continent, but rather a civilization. It was a home base of an advanced civilization of three races of humans occupying different sections of a huge island empire, which underwent three incarnations over a 100,000 year period. The three races were the Celts, Kantekkians, and a third race that no longer exists, somewhat resembling Australian or Guinean aborigines, only lighter in complexion. Atlantis existed during the ice age, and the world's climate was scarcely any colder away from the ice sheets than it is today. The sea level was several hundred feet lower during that time due to ice piled up at the poles. Atlantis was largely destroyed by one of the three cataclysms, and the Paranthas, a nation of a race mentioned above, were at war with the Celts of India. The Vedas were written by the descendants of Parantha, as per "Divine guidance."

Ask: Who were the Paranthas?
The Paranthas were a nation or race mentioned above, and were the antecedents of the Aboriginal people of Australia.

Ask: What is known about the Kantekkians?
The Kantekkians were a group of people who were involved in the division of the "Sons of One" and the "Sons of Belial" in Atlantis. They were also associated with the Celts and were originally from the Kurgan region, north and west of the Caucasus. Some of them arrived on the Canary Islands 12,000 years ago, possibly from Atlantis, and were known for their propensity for head hunting to accrue negative energy and power.

Ask: Elaborate about the deivision of the "Sons of One".
The "Sons of One" were a philosophical and religious division, which was initially a racial division between the "Sons of Belial" and the "Sons of One." The Kantekkians were the "Sons of Belial," and the "Sons of One" were associated with the monotheistic idea, which was perverted to Judaism and then transformed into the Christian religious mythos. The division was woven by those who portray the lights and has been an ongoing theme since Atlantean times.
