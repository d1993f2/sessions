# 2009
## January 3, 2009
This session is going to have some blanks in it since we were discussing a health issue due to the fact that a member of our household was ill over Christmas and nearly died. Christmas was a rather grim affair for us this year. I'll edit it as tight as I can so that anything of general interest can be read.

Laura, Ark, family, Chateau Crew, a guest

**A:** !Hello QFS! How is the weather? Gonna get nippy!

**Q:** (L) Who do we have with us?

**A:** Sonoriaea transmitting through Cassiopaea.

**Q:** (L) We have a guest here tonight who would like to ask some questions. I'd to keep it short since I don't have a lot of energy. So, D\*\*\*\*\*? (D) Okay, I'd like to know what to focus on during my transitional period?

**A:** Find the desire of the heart. Not so easy, though.

**Q:** (D) Any clues?

**A:** False personality must die for the heart to be revealed.

**Q:** (D) Okay, so how can I move in that direction?

**A:** It cannot be done alone. You know the drill quite well, just a bit shy about commencing.

**Q:** (D) Okay... I'm not sure what to make of that. (L) Well, I guess that's it. That's the same thing they would tell me! (D) It can't be done alone, okay. Can I ask one more? So is there someone specific, or...

**A:** The process of the mirror is the most reliable way of seeing one's true reflection. You can see your soul that way.

**Q:** (L) When you say "mirror" do you mean a literal mirror, or do you mean "mirror" as we use it in QFS?

**A:** Both.

**Q:** (L) I have a question I want to ask. A lot of people say that esotericism and politics shouldn't be mixed together, that somebody who has esoteric pursuits - or spiritual pursuits, let me put it that way - shouldn't be interested in "worldly" things. I would like to have your view on this. Have we gone completely astray by mixing in politics?

**A:** Absolutely and vehemently not!!! There is no possibility of true spiritual work progressing without full awareness of the world that surrounds you. What have we said about "true religion?" Let your curiosity guide you. In its pure state curiosity is a spiritual function.

**Q:** (L) There was something else I wanted to ask also... Oh yeah! We did an I Ching for the year 2009. Basically it's "Biting Through", that once you've got the bite in your mouth, you've got to chew it. So, I was wondering if you had any comments on the year ahead?

**A:** Biting Through may apply more to those who are unprepared.

**Q:** (L) Unprepared in what sense?

**A:** 2009 is going to be a "smashing" year.

**Q:** (L) Swell. (J) Comets.

**A:** Maybe one...?

**Q:** (Discussion of answer) (L) Alright, what do you want to ask, J\*\*\*? Nothing in particular? (L) How about \_\_\_\_'s health? ...

{...}

**A:** Remember there are those "out there" that would desire greatly to see this work end and will stoop to attack in insidious ways.

**Q:** (L) When you say "out there", what do you mean?

**A:** Both on and off planet.

{....}

**Q:** (\_\_\_) What about the diet I'm eating now: mostly fruits and vegetables and a little bit of meat?

**A:** More protein needed for amino acids of a natural and balanced type.

**Q:** (\_\_\_\_) So that means the amino acid supplements I'm taking aren't good?

**A:** Stop and eat meat. Your type needs the highest level and quality of protein.

**Q:** (\_\_\_\_\_) But I don't like meat! (C) You used to! (J) You do like meat. (\_\_\_\_) No I don't!

**A:** Many of your current ideas and preferences may not be "yours."

**Q:** (A\*\*\*\*) We all kind of knew that...

**A:** Do not underestimate the opposition.

{....}

**Q:** .... (J) Are we talking about things being beamed? Is that the main...

**A:** "Beamed" and otherwise. Hitchhikers and image formation and projection along with emotional manipulation via [planchette is moving too fast for Laura to call out letters, then it slows] various EM frequencies.

**Q:** (L) Thanks for slowing down there! (laughter) (A\*\*\*\*) How do you protect yourself against these frequencies?

**A:** Few people on the planet get treated to such special attention.

**Q:** ...... (S) I have a question. They said "various EM frequencies". Well, what I'm thinking is the WiFi inside the house, and...

**A:** Very bad!!!!!!!!!!

**Q:** (S) Okay, so we can just use a very long ethernet cable instead of the WiFi.

**A:** Research frequencies and cancelling frequencies for ideas. But the main thing is mental blocking. Notice that \_\_\_\_\_\_ is similarly affected due to frequency similarity.

**Q:** (J) Frequency of the person, or frequency of the...

**A:** Note birth dates.

**Q:** .... (A\*\*\*\*) Is this numerology based? (L) Well, I dunno, I think it's probably numerology/astrology, plus maybe the time of year and some kind of frequencies of the sun sign maybe. Is that it?

**A:** Yes. More or less.

{...}

**Q:** .... (Ark) You were asking about this WiFi, and it's bad, but I want to ask about this USB stick with the little antenna on our Asus? It radiates microwaves like cellphones. Is it strong?

**A:** Also bad. You would be surprised what tiny things can do. In all cases, however, there are remedies and safety measures.

**Q:** (S) Well, this kind of my question. Because we have cell phones that are so evil, right? The problem is that even if you never use a cell phone, there are towers EVERYWHERE. If a cell phone is on and it's close to you, that's worse, but... (L) You can't escape it all. (S) So we can obviously turn off the evil stuff, but... (L) I think there's also the stuff out there for cancelling that is dietary {like minerals}, or something you can do.

**A:** Silk is always good.

**Q:** (Ark) But coming back to this USB stick and little antenna which is probably very weak, what would be the distance from this that you would consider to be safe?

**A:** 2 meters.

**Q:** (Ark) Oh, so this is really weak. (S) Is it the same for WiFi? (discussion of evil microwaves and what to do)

**A:** Consider a "Faraday cage" for \_\_\_ until she is stronger.

**Q:** (\_\_\_) They're gonna put me in a cage! Aah!! (L) Where the heck would we get one? (Ark) No, that's impossible. (J) You can build one! (L) Well, they put it in quotes, so they must have meant something special. (S) Drape silk around her bed. (Ark) Yes, because Faraday cage to prevent from microwaves would have such tiny little openings that there would be no air to breathe...

**A:** Scottie has the right idea.

**Q:** (L) What did Scottie say? (S) I was saying that if she's going to be in her bed, instead of mosquito netting, you have a silk netting. (Ark) No! A suit of armor like the warriors in the old times used. (L) I don't think that's very practical, dear. (laughter) (Ark) Silk is a Faraday cage. (S) Why silk? Why silk protects against these things is totally bizarre to me. (Ark) Well, it's made by animals. (L) It's made by caterpillars.

**A:** Mulberry.

**Q:** (L) That's what the caterpillars eat to make silk. (J) So \_\_\_\_\_ should take Mulberry extract? (laughter) (\_\_\_\_\_) And Then I can start making silk? (L) If you start doing weird things, I'm outta here! (laughter) (\_\_\_\_\_) What can I do to mentally block?

**A:** Right now you need help as you are ... weak. But the general principle can be understood from the term "righteous anger." If you think about the expression that the fate of the universe may depend on you it should make you angry.

**Q:** (L) That wasn't very clear, was it? (A\*\*\*\*) That expression?

**A:** No. The fate of the universe can be altered negatively and many will suffer if you are out of the picture. That is what "they" want.

**Q:** (D) So your first priority has to be to stay healthy and make sure you take care of yourself. (S) We need to get you a superhero outfit. (\_\_\_\_\_) Made of silk! (laughter)

**A:** Each of you here tonight have a specific role to play in the coming cosmic drama. Best to always keep that in mind.

**Q:** (A\*\*\*\*) Can I ask a question? (L) Yes, dear. (A\*\*\*\*) What would be a good way to calm my anxiety?

**A:** Carefully avoid foods that play havoc with your system and remember that all which affects those with whom you are genetically connected can affect you also.

**Q:** (L) So you're probably getting some of what's hitting \_\_\_\_. (A\_\_\_\_ Oh, YOU! God, get better, would you? (laughter) (J) How much vitamin C should \_\_\_\_ take?

**A:** No more than 6 grams per day.

**Q:** (L) I would have said 8. (Ark) 6. (S) I thought you could take like 50 grams a day or something. (L) Well, that was when she was really sick, but she needs to stop doing that. (Ark) 6. (S) For silk, is it more important to protect the head and brain, or the body, or doesn't it matter?

**A:** Everything. And D\_\_\_\_\_ should keep a silk scarf about her throat.

**Q:** (L) Do you have any? (D) Yeah. Even in the summer though? It's hot in the summer.

**A:** Thin silk.

**Q:** (D) Well, thin silk. Right, okay. (A\_\_\_\_) Can I ask another question? (L) Yes. (A\_\_\_\_) Why do I have so much deja vu?

**A:** The program is constantly being meddled with at present.

{...}

**Q:** ....(D) I have a question for Laura and Ark. What can bring them more happiness to balance out all the stress and difficult things in their life?

**A:** Not to worry. They have a gold star or two already. More help of a practical nature is also good.

{....}

**Q:** (D) Can I ask what country might be a good place to think about for me?

**A:** As things develop that will be obvious. Must not interfere here!

**Q:** (L) If they told you such-and-such a country and you met somebody from that country then it might change the way you reacted to them. (D) Oooh, yeah, that's a good point. (L) So, if you don't know, everything will be clean and clear. (D) Thank you. (A\_\_\_\_) Good night Wisconsin, we love you!

**A:** Goodbye.

END OF SESSION

The comment about a "smashing year" became interesting with the recent storm here during which a LOT of trees around our house came crashing down and one of them smashed into our barn totally destroying half of it. This storm that was said to be the worst in France's history (or at least a very long time) followed, by one week, the sighting of a "UFO" in Toulouse which is about 40 minutes away. We carried the story on SOTT.

[A UFO in the Toulouse Sky?](http://www.sott.net/articles/show/173544-A-UFO-in-the-Toulouse-Sky-)

![toulouse_meteor.jpg](assets/images/ddb669954163ae753e0fa1931be6c343.jpg) 

The story from our local paper includes the following:

> In Toulouse's Jolimont observatory, Laurent Koechlin saw the strange UFO too. He confirms, while remaining cautious. "We received several calls on Monday. It was indeed a meteor, which means the object was real and was falling from the sky. It's the second one I've seen in my life. My opinion would be that it's a natural element, but we'll have to cross-check the information in order to know more. I think it was big enough not to be entirely pulverized. In my opinion, he fell somewhere and should be looked for in the South, maybe in the Pyrénées." 

Whether there is any relation between the alleged meteor and the subsequent weather, I don't know, I just find it curious.
