"Frank", "Candy", Laura

After a brief encounter with an easily identifiable "dead dude," whom we sent away, we used our Reiki symbols, asked specifically for our communicants from Cassiopaea and the following came through:

**Q:** We want to communicate with the Cassiopaeans.

**A:** I am Ra keeper of light.

**Q:** What are you here to tell us?

**A:** UFO not all bad.

**Q:** Why is the connection so bad tonight?

**A:** You see you are tired.

**Q:** [Unknown question.]

**A:** Level through 6.

**Q:** [Unknown question.]

**A:** Planet.

**Q:** [Unknown question.]

**A:** Always. Please let me go.

It was clear that the energy was very weak on this last contact. It was also curious that the character "Ra" came through and identified himself as a "keeper of light."
