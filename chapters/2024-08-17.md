**Q:** (L) So let's see if we can get going here... All right. Hello?

**A:** Love to all from Siennoraea of Cassiopaea.

**Q:** (L) Why are we so slow? Is our board…?

(Andromeda) We need powder?

(L) I dunno. Maybe we need a little light dusting. It feels staticky. We've got static on our glass here.

(Joe) It's probably got moisture on it too from the past few weeks.

(L) Well, yeah. It's been pretty damp. Oh, the introduction: Today is August 17, 2024. \[Review of those present\]

\[Break while Andromeda finds talc to lubricate (and gently perfume) the board...\]

(L) You couldn't find the usual ones, so we're going to have rose. Isn't that a nice smell? Lovely. Where did you get this one? Outta my bathroom?

(Andromeda) Mm-Hmm.

(L) Stealing my stuff! \[laughter\]

(Andromeda) For a good cause!

(L) All right, now here we go... Okay. We had our introduction. I gave the date, the time, or the attendees and so forth. So we're ready to go. Are we ready to go with questions?

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (L) Oh, that's much better. Okay. I wanna talk about this alleged Illuminati insider. His name is S\_ S\_\_, but he introduced himself as “The Ruiner” by writing a blog. And, according to our AI synopsis:

_He presents a narrative on the secretive operations of the so-called Illuminati, a group he claims to have been raised within. He describes his various roles from training others in telekinetic attack to teaching the operation of cloned bodies, and ultimately, disinforming a government agency about paranormal activities. His transition through these roles reflects his struggle with the moral implications of his actions and his “abundant” conscience._

(L) Okay, well, we're not going to go through that document completely, but he says, first of all, that ascending to a higher density isn't what the human experience is about. So he negates the C's on that point. And I'm not going to be asking argumentative questions like this, so don't get in an uproar here. And here he says, “I don't think that anyone doesn't have a soul, but there are certainly people who are very disconnected and running on autopilot.” But it just reflects two types of people: the transhumanist versus the organic or the natural ones. The NPCs, he says, (or what we would call OPs), are on a different frequency. They choose not to see things. He says, "I don't think it's the case of them not having a soul in the body. I think it's just that they weren't resonating. I think it's temporary." Is there any comment about that?

**A:** Soul smashing anyone?

**Q:** (L) Hmm? What does that mean?

**A:** Those with souls can be "smashed". Those without simply merge back in the pool.

**Q:** (L) Okay. He says that what AI programs are studying is our magic - that is, humans' magic - which he defines as what we as humans are organically capable of. Any comment?

**A:** Any living creature on Earth is organic. Humans have souls. At least half of them. Doing anything organically is nothing special.

**Q:** (L) So you're saying that whatever human beings do organically is not anything special. Is that what you're saying?

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (L) And you're saying that whatever we do organically is not magic. Is that...?

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (L) Are AI programs studying our magic?

**A:** No

**Q:** (L) Are AI programs studying anything?

**A:** Many things.

**Q:** (L) Okay. Do you have something on that, Joe?

(Joe) The first answer: "Those with souls can be smashed, those without simply merge back into the pool." How did that relate to the question you asked?

(L) I asked them to comment on what I read.

(Joe) Right, but what you read was...

(Chu) He was saying everybody has a soul.

(Joe) Right? So...

(L) It was just a comment. Can any of you guys think of a question about this AI business? Make it quick.

(Joe) Maybe... Was the, "Soul smashing anyone?" answer, was that suggesting that people who listened to or follow what this guy is saying are setting themselves up for that?

(L) That they're being set up for soul smashing. Is that what you were suggesting about that?

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (L) So people who follow this guy's ideas and buy into it are setting themselves up for soul smashing. Well, one of the first things he did in this video was, you know, claim how right he was about so many things and he was like, batting a thousand for however many years and so on and so forth.

**A:** By design. STS sources can be "starkly accurate" when it suits their agenda.

**Q:** (L) Okay. He says that the Wave has hit us and is causing an evolution. The peak of the Wave was in 2020.

(Andromeda) We missed it! \[laughter\]

(L) Yeah, we missed it!

(Joe) When Biden got elected. November, 2020!

(L) So I mean, there are just so many points that he is saying that we know aren't true. And I mean, it's not just because the C's have said so, but because we've done the research.

(Andromeda) And observed.

(L) Yeah. So, he says the Wave has hit us and is causing an evolution.

**A:** The Wave is in the early stages and is causing chaos. Will that lead to evolution? In some rare cases, yes.

**Q:** (Joe) Only rare cases. \[laughter\]

(L) I mean, it's just...

(Chu) Two people came up with a question about AI if you want them.

(L) Okay. One question. Can AI read our mind referring to targeted advertising?

**A:** No. But it can read your emails, searches, note websites you have visited, and even listen.

**Q:** (Joe) So basically Google. Like your phone.

(L) And it either draws something directly from what you've been doing or makes assumptions or predictions about where your mind will go based on what you've been doing, saying or looking at. Is that it?

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (L) It's kind of like that... I don't know if any of y'all saw that video about the guy who's, like, a mentalist or something and he...

(Andromeda) You're thinking about Derren Brown who does the programming, pre-programming, and then can guess what you're going to come up with based on...?

(L) Yeah, yeah. Derren Brown. Watching that video is amazing. I mean, if you get exposed to certain things, he took prompts, basically, he took these people, put 'em in a car and drove them to an office along a certain route where there were certain things along the side of the road on their way there. And then, once they got there, asked them to create an advertising program, you know, for whatever it was. And both of them used almost identical elements from the things that they had seen along their route, you know? I mean, it had like a gate to a graveyard and a bear and an angel. I mean, it was bizarre. But the funny thing was that I was noticing the things that were along the route too, as we were going along. I didn't realize what was going on. Okay. And then the other question was: Is it a fault with AI that it uses prior assumptions about how information is distributed, and this may be vastly wrong, as it's based on 3D assumptions?

**A:** Is it wrong with most people?

**Q:** (L) No. It probably makes pretty darn good assumptions because it uses prior information about what most people think and do in response to... just like this Derren Brown thing, right? But for people who don't think that way, then obviously they're not going to be so easy to read. People who are not programmable, people who are not impressionable or suggestible in the same ways. So...

(Andromeda) Because there's a spectrum of suggestibility.

(L) Okay... He thinks that World War III seems most likely, but we can't really know. According to him, the US election is part of the show. And Trump wouldn't have been in the picture if he wasn't allowed.

(L) Well, I don't think so because the C's - long before Trump came on the scene and ran for president, and we were watching everything going south at that time - said there was going to be a big miscalculation made, and it was going to expose everything. And that's exactly what happened: Trump was elected because of a big miscalculation. I mean, they didn't realize how many votes they were going to have to fake for Hillary in order to overcome the massive turnout for Trump. And they simply were not prepared. And he was, I believe, a big miscalculation. I mean, maybe they've done a lot of adjusting and they've gotten to him since then. But at the time, he was a big miscalculation. And he wasn't “allowed”. He wasn't allowed to do anything! He managed to get some things done, but I mean, they fought him every freaking inch of the way. And they spent all the time trying to take his money through lawsuits and, his time, his energy, to destroy his mind, his health, everything. I mean, no, you know, anybody who can't see that I don't think can see anything.

(Joe) In a session from 2017, there was a question about if they'd impeach Trump - this was after he'd become president. And they said, "Why impeach a perfectly good puppet?" And they also said in that session that he "gave in to the Deep State." So things changed along the way.

(L) Yeah.

(Joe) So, does that still hold true today?

(L) Well, anybody that gets into that position is basically asking to become a puppet because they're so exposed.

(Joe) Is he a willing puppet, though?

(L) Yeah, well... The C's have mixed reviews about Trump. I mean, very mixed.

(Joe) So is he a puppet? Is our take on Trump close to the reality?

(L) And what is our take?

(Joe) What you just described.

(L) Oh, I'm just talking about the election.

(Joe) Yeah. But in general, a guy came in, not a career politician, came in, thought he was going to be president, found out the hard way. Deep State runs the show, and he's just been trying his best since then. He's well intentioned, but he just isn't able to do anything 'cause they have him hamstrung.

(L) Well, yeah. Yeah. I think that that's what is. Is that basically the way it is?

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (L) So: S\_\_ and Jay say that it's mind blowing that people are still falling for this: "If you think Trump is your savior from Biden, then you're still telling them, “'I'm stupid, and I deserve what you wanna give me.'" Well, I don't think anybody here thinks that Trump is a savior from anything, because they're never going to allow him to do anything really significant.

(Joe) In my opinion, the main purpose or the main service that Trump has provided for people who are able to see it, is that by attempting to be the president and do his own thing, and then fighting against them, he has exposed them. He has forced them to a large extent to come out of the woodwork and show their hand. It showed the American people and the world population who really runs America.

(L) Yeah. Well, that's what the C's said would happen. They said big miscalculation, and it would expose the Deep State.

(Joe) Right. It's not about whether or not Trump's going to save anybody. Trump's "service to humanity" was to simply be the kind of guy he is, which is, you know, Art of the Deal, "I'm going down fighting" and that kind of thing, and force them to show their hand. After that it's all gravy.

(L) Yeah, I mean, they'll NEVER let him really do anything significantly effective. Never.

(Joe) And they just tried to kill him.

(L) Yeah. Okay... Now, there was something that was on the video about clones, and that bothered me a lot because it seemed to me that they didn't understand what a clone is, or they were using the terminology loosely. I'm going to describe what a clone is. If anybody has information that alters what I'm going to say, speak up. From what I understand, a clone is when the DNA of a selected individual, whether it's a sheep or a human, is implanted into a fertilized egg or embryo, which then gestates with this changed or switched-out DNA and it is born or hatched or whatever in a normal way, and then goes through a growing-up process and becomes basically, a genetic duplicate of whatever the source of the DNA was. And they're talking about it as though you can make a clone last week, you know, run it for a couple of weeks, and then it just kind of runs down like a robot and you have to toss it aside. And that's like they're assuming that there is some super rapid growth process that they put this DNA through to produce a clone of something or somebody. So does anybody have any information on that which would change what I just said?

(Approaching Infinity) I think your definition of a clone is accurate for what human scientists do. But like in the sessions, the C's, when they talk about clones... That was in the MIA and KIA discussion when they talk about actually duplicating a dead body. And it sounds, from the discussion, that what they were talking about was that 4D STS will actually create a duplicate of the body at the age that it died at and then reinsert that body. So I think there's two types of clones: There's the traditional, like human science cloning where they do as you say, and you create a new being from embryo to, you know, full growth. And then there's the kind of like paranormal weird version where they create like an actual duplicate of a body as it exists at a particular state and age.

(L) Okay, well then, but this kind of doesn't really get into the hyperdimensional aspect of things and that comes along later and demonstrates that he has no real idea what it is. A hyperdimensionally-manufactured clone would be manufactured as you say, it is manufactured in hyperdimensional space and basically, an exact match of somebody. And then it can be put back into 3D. If that is done, does such a clone that is manufactured in hyperdimensional space and then is put into 3D to function in some way, does that type of clone kind of like run out of gas or deteriorate in a short period of time?

**A:** Not usually. Normally the cloned body is then occupied by the life force of the "donor".

**Q:** (L) So a body that's cloned in 4D and put back into 3D could then theoretically go on to live a regular lifespan?

(Joe) That's like bringing the person back to life.

(L) Yeah.

(Joe) Their life force goes back into the clone body. So it's the same person.

(L) Yeah. But they've cloned a new body that's based on the old one, and then the life force just goes into the new one. They put 'em back in.

(Joe) Somebody dies in a war and gets all mangled up, take the body in 4D, fix it up, put 'em back in, off you go. Nothing happened.

(Ark) Is the soul also being cloned?

**A:** Not normally done with fully souled beings.

**Q:** (L) So in other words, that's what they do with OPs. They have life force, you know, the soul pool thing, and...

(Joe) They're less resistant to just getting back in and getting on with it. Whereas, a souled person that died in a war or something like that, or however they died, that may have been the end of their normal planned soul lifecycle. It's not like get back in, you just say, "I had voted to check out at that point." So bye-bye. (Plus there is the problem of trauma to the soul that registers everything and forgets nothing.)

(L) Okay. So this guy S\_\_ says that they, i.e. I guess the Illuminati people need bodies for armies. He thinks that they tested one or several around the Super Bowl in LA where cops were popping out of the subway. Were they testing these types of cloned bodies?

**A:** They often do.

**Q:** (L) But they would be testing bodies that were cloned as you described it, you know, like hyperdimensionally cloned? (And it would not necessarily be the “Illuminati” doing it.)

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (L) So apparently S\_\_ says underground bases are not 4th density, they're just big empty spaces underground.

**A:** False and part of his mission.

**Q:** (L) So you're saying part of his mission is to distort and mislead or even to directly contradict what the C's said?

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (Joe) You didn't ask about his background.

**Q:** (L) Well, hold on. It's coming. He says underground cities are a different thing, and that's for if you make it into the Illuminati, that's where they'd live. Is that true?

**A:** No.

**Q:** (L) Okay. So the Illuminati do not live in the underground cities. Well, you've already described underground cities for us in the past, so... (They are for 4D STS activities.) Where do the Illuminati live?

**A:** All over the planet. But there are a very limited number of them.

**Q:** (Andromeda) Like how many? \[laughter\]

(L) Yeah, like how many?

(Andromeda) Rough estimate?

**A:** Less than 3300.

**Q:** (L) Why are there so few of them?

**A:** They keep their genes strictly to themselves. As a result, inbreeding has led to a decline in their numbers.

**Q:** (L) Well, this guy S\_\_ says he's the offspring of an Illuminati-descended mother and I guess a truck driver father or something like that. \[laughter\] Yeah. How likely is that?

**A:** Zero.

**Q:** (L) So it really is like the way it’s described in that Georgia Le Carre book that any offspring that are born from somebody who's from an Illuminati family with somebody who's an outsider is killed, or actually they try to prevent them being born - force them to have abortions. They don't allow them to be born. So what is this guy's backstory? I mean, did he come out of some kind of cult?

**A:** No

**Q:** (Joe) Is he a LARPer?

**A:** Close. Very bright but narcissistic and thus sort of Dunning/Kruger in his research.

**Q:** (L) So if he wanted to make everything realistic, he could have researched longer and harder and come up with better answers. Is he doing this just because it is like a grift or something? Or is he an agent?

**A:** Former.

**Q:** (Joe) Dude on the internet talking nonsense to make money?

(L) So in other words, I don't really need to go through all the rest of these questions. I mean, it says that he says the Draco headquarters is in Canada and repurposed by human controllers. It's what they call Babylon.

(Joe) He probably got ChatGPT to make up most of it and put it on his website. \[laughter\] I just wrote a book! I can write a book tomorrow with ChatGPT.

(L) He also said: “The most powerful manifestors in the world seem to be sociopaths, psychopaths, and narcissists. And they managed to do that without a solid foundation because they have powerful conviction. And conviction is”... Oh dear. Oh dear. (He hasn’t got a clue about psychopathology.) Well, okay, so much for that. I mean, I think we've spent enough time on this. Change gears. Let me ask you: Is the Billionaire Banker series by Georgia Le Carre the closest we can get to looking behind the scenes into Illuminati families (their relationships, how they operate)?

**A:** Yes

**Q:** (L) The only problem is it's chick-lit porn. \[laughter\] So I mean, it is not really a book you want to recommend to anybody! Geez.

(Joe) Yeah. Maybe it depends on the person, but like, I don't need to read that book to know. Because after over 20 years of periodically getting little intimations of what goes on in those circles, it's like, yeah... And I don't want to read about it!

(L) Yeah. Well, actually in a certain sense, the pornographic element is entirely appropriate to the Illuminati groups. I mean, you know, they're... wow (pretty sick individuals). Yeah. And is the book “The Other Side of Midnight”, which is related to the Billionaire Banker series, is that a metaphor for 4D STS relationship with humanity?

**A:** Very close.

**Q:** (L) But part of the story is that one of these STS-type dudes somehow turns over and becomes STO in the end. Is that possible?

**A:** Yes, but rare.

**Q:** (L) Okay. Well... Has anything on these previous two topics excited any of you to any curiosities or questions that are related to them before we move to our next topic?

(Ryan) Laura, I was actually wondering if the C's could tell us how many humans are in the Quorum?

**A:** Quorum is mostly "hyperdimensional". Few humans.

**Q:** (L) Is that enough? Are you really angling for an exact number?

(Ryan) I was hoping they could tell us how many the human portion of the Quorum was.

(Joe) They said very few.

**A:** Varies.

**Q:** (L) So I guess it varies from time to time. Okay, now I want to ask about Jean-Pierre Garnier Malet's “Theory of the Doubling of Time and Space". Is this theory that he's come up with - his ideas about time and gravity and space and so forth - if they could ever be elucidated with any clarity, are they close to being descriptive of different densities?

**A:** Close, but not close enough and he has some things exactly backwards.

**Q:** (L) Well, he says that he came to this idea sometime, I think around 1988 or something. And he had an encounter with a being, apparently, for 15 minutes, and all this stuff came into his head and because of his background in physics and...

(Ark) Physics and engineering.

(L) He's in engineering, but also, what was it, hydrodynamics or something?

(Ark) Yeah.

(L) So he's got a background that is kind of similar to Jean-Pierre Petit's. Except that after he got his PhD, he quit and he went off to work in the theater. And that's kind of like a real strange combination. So what kind of a being did he have an encounter with?

**A:** 4D STS.

**Q:** (L) And why did this being give him this information?

**A:** Muddy the waters.

**Q:** (L) Okay. But what about his thing about the cycling around of space and time? He says they cycle round and he even draws a picture of it. It's like a cycling yin yang symbol, almost. And it seems to me that when the cycle comes and meets in the end, you know, like the past and the future and everything kind of meets in the middle, that that would be the definition of the whole Wave process. But he's saying that all space and time does this, and that it cycles forever. And that kind of fits with some of the C's definitions about the Wave. They say it's always there, it's cycling through the universe forever. And so that struck me as being very close to what he was talking about, this cycling of space and time, and this doubling thing. Is that in fact the case?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (L) So, if it was done very carefully, we could extract something from what he has written. I mean, very little, probably like 2% of the whole book. But it might still be useful. Is that true?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (L) Okay. Is it true that every observer exists simultaneously in different timescales?

**A:** We have told you this. His idea of "timescales" is more akin to densities.

**Q:** (L) Well, since he's so vague and we already talked about it at some length, I guess we'll end that topic and get to some of the group’s questions. How long have we been on here?

(Chu) One hour 16.

**Q:** (L) For the session?

(Chu) No, the session alone has been going for probably one hour now.

**Q:** (L) Okay. Here's some questions:

(Altair) According to British MP Andrew Bridgen, NATO is planning a “dirty bomb” false flag in Europe. He says: "Services tell me there is going to be a "9/11-like" nuclear detonation in Europe" and he asks "unless NATO is behind it, how would UK intelligence services know?" Is this on the table for Europe or Ukraine?

**A:** Very possible.

**Q:** (irjO) What is the total percentage of votes Maduro obtained? (In the 2024 presidential elections)

**A:** 63.

**Q:** (L) 63 percent?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (L) Well, that's higher than what they say in the polls...

(Niall) Yes. So they tried to rig it against him

(L) It was another Trump-like situation. (It’s sad that Trump and Musk can’t see that and Musk went on to attack Maduro.)

(Joe) And then said that he rigged it. With the lower figure they gave, they said he rigged that!

(L) Yeah, they're such liars!

(Andromeda) They're terrible.

(Chu) I think in the beginning, Joe and Niall had questions...

(Joe) What's at the top of that list? Didn't you start at the top?

(Andromeda) She did.

(Gaby) No, the very top.

(Andromeda) Yeah. Oh... sorry.

(L) Oh, it said "Joe and Niall have questions about Trump". Well, that wasn't a question, so I just ignored it! \[laughter\]

(Andromeda) It was very tiny! \[laughter\]

(Joe) It's very short questions. Very quick and easy answers. \[laughter\]

(L) All right, go for it.

(Joe) Did Crooks (the guy who allegedly shot at Trump) actually shoot at Trump? Was he the one shooting at Trump? Shooting a bullet at Trump…?

**A:** He shot, yes.

**Q:** (Joe) And he shot all of the eight bullets attributed to him.

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (L) Was his the bullet that hit Trump?

(Joe) Yeah. Did one of his bullets hit Trump's ear?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Joe) So, and was it just luck, let's say, that made Trump turn his head?

**A:** Divine intervention.

**Q:** (Joe) Divine intervention by Trump's higher self?

**A:** Yes. Powered by mass prayers.

**Q:** (Niall) Was Thomas Crooks groomed in any way?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Niall) So he was handled, okay.

(L) Was there another shooter on site?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Niall) Did this other shooter on site take out Crooks?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Joe) And where did he fire from? Was he behind Crooks?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Joe) He was behind Crooks in the building, in one of the windows, one of the sniper people?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Niall) The last window maybe...

(Joe) There was at least one little UFO-type thing moving very fast. We don't know if there were one or two. There was definitely one, one that was caught clearly, maybe a number of seconds before Crooks fired the shots. It flew over the building or that general area, and it had a little kind of antenna on the back of it. You could freeze frame it to see it. And then there were other camera angles that saw another further away, with a more ball-like structure, though it could be the same one. But anyway, it was some kind of an anomalous, unidentified aerial vehicle in the air at the time of the shooting. What was... who owned that?

**A:** Drones.

**Q:** (Joe) And these are 3D drones run by Intel types?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Joe) And was it really moving at the speed it seemed to have been? Was it moving at 2000 miles an hour or something like that?

(L) No, it wasn't, because it was probably closer than you imagine.

(Joe) Maybe, but it was moving extremely fast.

(Niall) Yes.

(Joe) Way faster than any drone you can buy, even the top end, the best of them. And what was this purpose? Was it there to just monitor? Did it have any purpose other than monitoring the situation?

**A:** Mind control signals.

**Q:** (Joe) On Crooks?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Niall) Wow! Was the attempted assassination of Trump what the C's referred to…?

(Joe) They mentioned the program change...

(Niall) And the meeting with the Quorum.

(Joe) And they talked about program change upcoming. This was like in maybe February or March. They said it was in a timescale of months. Was that \[Trump's assassination attempt\] the anticipated program change, and it got subverted? Or is the program change still to come?

**A:** Program had to be changed to avoid mass violation of free will.

**Q:** (Joe) So the program was the planned assassination of Trump?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Joe) And... but it was changed to avoid mass violation of free will. And who made the decision to change the program?

**A:** Quorum.

**Q:** (Joe) Right. So they had a good think about it, and thought it was a bad idea.

**A:** Violations of free will on that scale are similar to violations of gravity in your realm.

**Q:** (Niall) It's like trying to break a natural law, or something. It's too much.

(L) Yeah, if you jump off the roof and you think you're not going to get hurt, that's violating gravity.

(Joe) So it was strange that such smart people in the Quorum would have not realized that that was a bad idea from the get go.

(L) Well, I don't think they expected so many people to be praying for Trump, and to be supporting him.

(Joe) Yes. Because that suggests that they didn't change it, because it was Trump that prevented his own assassination.

(L) Yeah. In a sense.

(Joe) They still intended to assassinate him. So they didn't change the program. The program was changed by other forces linked to Trump's higher self or whatever.

(L) Yeah. But it still is woven together.

(Joe) It is divine intervention, like they said.

(L) Yeah.

(Joe) Well, anything else Niall?

(Niall) On that? No.

(L) All right, moving on.

(seek10) One quick question, Laura. Is it the good guys in the Quorum who intervened?

**A:** Not the right concept.

**Q:** (Niall) Yeah. Remember the Quorum thinks in terms of... it's not good or bad per se, it's what will work. And remember they were thinking of resistance and balance as well. If they were going to off Trump, when there's so much support for him, at least some among them realize that's a breach, that's going too far.

(L) It's like Ra said, you know? If they go against the free will of humanity, STS gets degaussed.

(Joe) There's blowback.

(L) Yeah, serious blowback.

(Joe) Because in one of the last sessions, when talking about the Quorum and program changes, they said that the Quorum was meeting to affect changes, to produce more control. And we discussed it. But that control would lead to more resistance because more balance is needed. So it brings in the question of whether these people in the Quorum are aware of the broader scale of things.

(L) They might have lost control completely, if they had actually succeeded.

(Joe) Right. And they're aware of the broader dynamics involved and how balance is needed. But you know... because it is weird, they're planning to create resistance by introducing some kind of pandemic or some things that are going to make people suffer...

(Andromeda) Some sort of extra control...

(Joe) ...that will cause resistance. And that creates more balance, right? So it's almost like the idea of people who are intending evil but doing good.

(Andromeda) Right.

(Joe) But they're aware of that as well, at the same time. So it's probably kind of high-level stuff. And it's not so simple.

(L) It's a way of thinking that we don't... we hardly can fathom.

(Joe) It's big picture thinking, you know?

(L) All right, next question.

(msante) Javier Milei's unauthorized biographer and inner circle claim that he had a “divine revelation” in 2019 that prophesied to him that he would be president of Argentina. The story goes that when his dog Conan died (2017) Milei was devastated. It was at that time that he contacted a medium who taught Milei's sister how to communicate with his dog. It is through his sister (she officiates as a medium) that Milei communicates with his dog, and it is through the dog that Milei talks to an entity he calls “the one”. Is there any truth to this story, and if so, what is the nature of this "one"?

(Andromeda) Oh boy!

(L) Jesus Christ! It's worse than I thought.

(Chu) That's what he claims!

(Niall) This is politics today.

(L) First of all, is there any truth to this story?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (L) Oh dear! What is the nature of this "one" that Milei talks to through his dog?

**A:** 4D STS.

**Q:** (L) That's why he's all for Israel and the US and...

(irjO) A follow-up question about Maduro: Was Elon Musk involved behind the attacks against Venezuela, as Maduro pointed out when Elon was criticizing the election results?

**A:** Only peripherally.

**Q:** (L) I think Elon Musk has some serious blind spots, and lack of deep and thorough education. Is that the best way to describe what's going on with him?

**A:** Close enough.

**Q:** (Chu) Plus the drugs he does, probably.

(Niall) Ketamine!

(Joe) They're all caught up in the American dream. It's a hard habit to break.

(Andromeda) Yeah...

(Joe) The team is going to make it! Murrika!! \[laughter\]

(Ellipse) Was there an agenda behind the Crowdstrike incident, or was it really an accident?

(Joe) Do you want me to explain that, Laura?

(L) Yeah, it says "Ask Joe". Explain that. We don't need the C's, we've got Joe! \[laughter\]

(Joe) No, just to explain the...

(Chu) Do you remember the Crowdstrike incident?

(L) Yeah. The internet went down, or something.

(Joe) Yeah. Okay. So you do know what it was! \[laughter\] Yeah, where the internet and airport software and all that kind of stuff...

(L) Yeah. I mean, it wasn't the whole internet, it was just...

(Joe) No, here and there, yeah. So what was the question?

(Scottie) The first question is, was it an accident or just a bug?

(L) Was it an accident?

(Joe) As they claimed?

**A:** No.

**Q:** (Joe) So was it a testing of their ability to shut stuff down?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Joe) Okay. That's what we figured.

(Niall) A report claims, based on food production and consumption statistics, that the population of the UK may have been as high as 80 million people... 17 years ago! The official number today is 67 million. Is this official number accurate?

**A:** No.

**Q:** (Niall) If not, what is it, to the nearest million?

**A:** 89.

**Q:** (Niall) Holy sh\*t! Oh my god! What is the population of France to the nearest million?

**A:** 76.

**Q:** (Niall) Okay. That's about 10 more than officially.

(Gaby) No wonder people have problems finding a doctor...

(Niall) So are they stuffing Western countries with people who are undocumented?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Joe) And they're not part of any census, so...

(Niall) And this is why there's a backlash. People know something is wrong. They don't have numbers like this. They don't have... but they're like, there's a thousand new people in their community overnight. And they're rioting.

(Joe) The thing is, we should have realized that, because years ago we asked about the population of the planet, and officially it was seven billion, but the C's said it was closer to eight. So there was an extra billion people to be accounted...

(Niall) I assumed from that whole answer that that was because, well, our number counting out there in Africa and Asia is so-so. But it's not there in Africa, it’s HERE!

(Joe) It's more likely it would be in wealthy countries, right? And that the increase in the population would be in cities and...

(Niall) The UK is tiny! 90 million people!

(Joe) Well, think about Tokyo. \[laughter\] Mexico City? \[laughter\]

(Puma) What is the probability of a mega-earthquake occurring in the next six months?

**A:** 48 percent.

**Q:** (L) So, a little less than half.

(Puma) In the session of January 21, 1995 the C's predicted a sequence of 13 earthquakes before an M9.6 earthquake in or near Tokyo. According to the VolcanoDiscovery database, 13 earthquakes M7+ have occurred since 2003 near Tokyo. Is this M9.6 earthquake still valid within the present timeline?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Puma) If this M9.6 earthquake is still valid, would this be the earthquake that the Japanese authorities expect to occur in Nankai Trough?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (L) It's just not going to be within the next six months. \[laughter\] Is it possible it's going to be sooner?

**A:** Possible.

**Q:** (L) I guess anything is possible. Okay.

(mkrnhr) There have been cases of attachments that persisted over several incarnations. When the host goes to 5D, where does the attachment go when there's still an energetic karmic affinity to the host?

**A:** Waits in Earth sphere.

**Q:** (L) So that's like...

(Andromeda) It waits for the host to reincarnate?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (L) So it kind of waits in a...

(Chu) Limbo.

(Joe) In the ether.

(L) Yes.

(Chu) Altair and Cosmos are asking what the real population of Germany is, but if we start asking about every country...

(L) Please! \[laughter\]

(Chu) You can probably add 10 million to every country, more or less.

(Niall) Though I think it's a Western thing. Germany and the US would be interesting. Japan has almost no immigration. It's very selective.

(Persej) Rene Quinton used seawater from a plankton-rich environment in his medical practice. Charles Schnabel promoted the health benefits of juice powder made from cereal grass grown on mineral-rich soil. Weston Price used butter from cows fed on cereal grasses as a source of activator X. Julius Hensel praised his Physiological Bread, made by fermenting the wheat flour mixed with mineral powder. It looks to me that minerals in a certain form might be the reason why those gentlemen had such positive results in their practice. Do minerals play a role in formation of beneficial information in certain foods or nourishment?

**A:** Indeed!

**Q:** (L) So that's a big 10-4.

(Andromeda) Didn't the C's say something about that once?

(Gaby) Trace minerals.

(L) Yeah, minerals being very important.

(Joe) And being bound up in the right food.

(Andromeda) Right.

(Z…) Is taking pine pollen beneficial for longevity and cancer prevention?

**A:** So-so.

**Q:** (L) So-so. So it's not bad and it's not good.

(Z…) Can taking pine pollen orally safely boost testosterone levels in males?

**A:** No

**Q:** (Gottathink) The genome of New Zealand's Pinus Radiata has 25 billion base pairs. Is the beneficial effects of consuming this pollen, according to research and anecdotal experience, related to this vast amount of information?

**A:** Close

**Q:** (Gottathink) Or is it more the quality of information that these base pairs encode for?

**A:** Close. More research needed.

**Q:** (Breo) Dr. Rashid A. Buttar says the Covid shots all contain a dormant virus (poison) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles which can be activated using specific 5G frequencies. Is this concept generally true, including with other EMFs?

**A:** Generally, yes.

**Q:** (Breo) Are there any technologies accessible to really protect from harmful frequency technologies?

**A:** Has been discussed in previous session.

**Q:** (Joe) Silk!

(Chu) But that's not necessarily a technology...

(L) Yeah, but there was also a discussion about using countering frequencies. You know, find out what the frequency that is coming at you is, and then have a device that emits one that cancels it out. Because you're dealing with waves, right? So you send out a canceling wave. So, canceling waves and silk.

(Niall) And Q-links?

(Joe) Our brains can send out canceling waves....

(Andromeda) Theoretically. (With enough knowledge.)

(Chu) So if these "nanobots", as they are called, exist, what is their main purpose? Mind control or health deterioration or something else?

**A:** Either/or.

**Q:** (Joe) Can they be shed? Can you contract them from people who have had them in the batches of vaccines…?

**A:** Cut them up.

**Q:** (Joe) What was that?

(Niall) Cut them up.

(Joe) Huh?

**A:** Chemical cleaving.

**Q:** (Gaby) Like detox?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Joe) What would you use for that?

(L) Like serrapeptase. Doesn't serrapeptase digest stuff like that?

(Gaby) Yeah. The protocols we discussed. Bromelain, nattokinase, ivermectin...

(Joe) So it is possible for them to be shed, and contracted by other people.

(L) Well, you have to cut them up and get rid of them out of your body.

(Joe) But my question was, people who have had them injected into them via the vaccine, and who have these nanobots in them... Are they "sheddable"?

**A:** Under some circumstances.

**Q:** (L) Well, I guess sex, or sharing body fluids of some sort, or...

(Gaby) Blood transfusions.

(L) Yeah, things like that.

(Joe) Yeah. But not just coughed in your face.

(Andromeda) Not like a germ.

(Joe) Not like the way you can shed the spike protein. You can't contract it the same way.

(L) Yeah, no. Okay. We're going to stop now, because I'm tired. And I know we've got more... and these are questions that are not crucial to the time, they're historical questions. So we're going to stop here. We'll start next time with question number 14 about the height of men during the Atlantean period and things about Newgrange, St. Patrick, Aryan invasions, ancient races... All right. So if there's anything that we should have asked, that is crucial to our survival or the survival of our group, that we didn't ask, please consider it asked from deep within our hearts, and give us some guidance.

**A:** You are doing well. Help is on the way! Goodbye.

**Q:** (L) Oh yeah. Well, you've been telling us help is on the way for so many years, I don't believe you anymore! \[laughter\]

(Andromeda) Are they trying to be funny? \[laughter\]
