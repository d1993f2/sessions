Frank, Laura

**Q:** I have a number of questions that I want to get into tonight. Frank and I have been discussing the nature of attack. The first thing I would like to ask is: I did a hypnosis session with MM and utilized some of the Greenbaum techniques. She responded in the affirmative. I was told that she had several alter personalities: "masterprogrammer, gatekeeper, Alpha, Beta, Theta and Delta, zero," and that there were over 3,000 installed programs. Were these responses valid?

**A:** Validity is subjective.

**Q:** Does MM have over 3,000 of these "programs?"

**A:** Be careful of data which originates from sources which mislead.

**Q:** Which is the misleading source?

**A:** May mislead.

**Q:** Which is misleading: MM or the Greenbaum text?

**A:** No its the center of origin.

**Q:** That which I perceive as a negative attachment?

**A:** This "subject" appears to be fragmented.

**Q:** So, MM is suffering from MPD?

**A:** Not that simple.

**Q:** Are her fragments caused by abductions?

**A:** She has had abductions and the like, but not the issue here. She is "searching," and when one is searching...

Session interrupted by long distance phone call and never resumed.
