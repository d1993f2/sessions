# Introduction

The name "Cassiopaea" was given by a consciously "channeled source" which Laura Knight-Jadyczk accessed in 1994 after two years of experimental work. The source identified itself by saying **"we are you in the future."** Modern physics does not provide us with practical means for this type of communication, and theories on this subject are not well developed; they are, in fact, inconclusive and controversial.

When interpreting **"we are you in the future"** in an oversimplified way, we are faced with causal paradoxes. On the other hand, from the theoretical papers published in physics journals we can learn that, with a proper and careful interpretation, and taking into account **quantum uncertainties**, communication into the past cannot be dismissed as impossible. Improbable perhaps is the right word, but there are many things that are improbable and yet happen.

The more improbable is a given phenomenon, the more information is carried by its occurrence, the more we can learn by its study.

That is why we did not dismiss the **"we are you in the future"** as impossible and therefore ignorable. Instead we decided to continue the "communications" as a form of a controlled experiment in "superluminal thought transfer" — even if it was clear that the term should be considered as a tentative indication of only one out several possible interpretations.

The information received from this experiment is presented in the context of broad ranging historical, scientific and other metaphysical material and offers the clues that have led to the world view and inferences presented by us in our numerous publications on this website and in print. Perhaps it is only our own "subconscious mind" that presents itself as a "source," but even if it is so, does that tell us more? Do we really know what "unconscious mind" is and of what is it capable?

We sometimes ask ourselves if the Cassiopaeans are who they say they are, because we do not take anything as unquestionable truth. We take everything with a grain of salt, even if we consider that there is a good chance that it is truth. We are constantly analyzing this material as well as a great quantity of other material that comes to our attention from numerous fields of science and mysticism. We find it to be quite extraordinary that the Cassiopaean Material is so closely aligned with the teachings of the great Sufi master, Ibn Al-‘Arabi, with the Fourth Way Teachings of Gurdjieff, Castaneda, with the Esoteric Christianity of Boris Mouravieff, and even ancient Altaic Shamanism. In this sense, the **Cassiopaean Experiment** is truly a Fourth Way work.

## About this book

This book is a growing compilation of the Cassiopaean Experiment session transcripts that can be found on the [Cassiopaea Forum](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/threads/cassiopaean-session-transcripts-by-date.13581/). Since the communication is still ongoing and old transcripts are being reviewed and published, it's only a snapshot of the repository, which can be outdated. The main purpose of this book is archival: to have the ability to read and ponder the material while offline.

The reader is advised to visit the Cassiopaea Forum to read about the ramifications and context of the session of interest, because those are not included in this compilation and often can change the meaning or work out some vagueness.
