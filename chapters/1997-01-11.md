[The Wave Chapter 18: All There Is Is Lessons, or A Trip to "Alligator Alley"](http://cassiopaea.org/2010/05/12/the-wave-chapter-18-all-there-is-is-lessons-or-a-trip-to-alligator-alley/)

Present: Laura, Frank, Terry, Jan, Guest "M"

**Q:** (Laura) Hello, and what name shall we use this evening?

**A:** Hello. Yonnuro.

**Q:** (Laura) And where are you transmitting from?

**A:** Cassiopaea.

**Q:** (Laura) We have M here with us this evening, as well as the usual crew. V is absent, her parents are visiting. We have been discussing...

**A:** Discuss prophecy, maybe?

**Q:** (Laura) No, we weren't discussing prophecy... (Terry) Well, no, maybe they want us to discuss prophecy...

**A:** Sure, why not?

**Q:** (Terry) Well, since they/we brought it up... (Laura) All right, give us a point to start on the subject of prophecy, and do any of the bizzarre events...

**A:** Well, it is important, you know. You have one here tonight who has been badly misled, controlled and programmed. In grave, grave danger. Another who attempted contact today... likewise.

**Q:** (Terry) Start at the beginning, and we'll start with M, and work on to J.

**A:** Must change at once!!!!

**Q:** (Laura) Change what?

**A:** Directions

**Q:** (Laura) Change directions in what?

**A:** Studies, life situations, etc... This is one who was recognized as having great potential for ultimate 4th density STO change over at a very early stage, thus attack was instituted then, and has slowly and steadily increased, with ultimate goal of total elimination. Sadly, that goal is on verge of realization?

**Q:** (Terry) Who is this guy (Name deleted - the man in touch with "M" who she was obsessing over)?

**A:** Is this really germane?

**Q:** (Laura) Well, that's what I really thought... (Terry) Is this guy involved?

**A:** No! What is important is the subject has been programmed to lead a life designed to "open the wrong doors." And when this transpires, with one of these target subjects, if they don't get help, or more importantly, do not listen to the guidelines, they are destroyed as part of a grand plan. {Discussion about marriage partners and close relations, including children, that can drain one's energy.}

**Q:** Is this what we are talking about?

**A:** Close. Those are not the only dangers. You asked about the "visitor." Well, what about that?? And what about your son's illness. What about the woman from across the street? What about Wilma, and her son? And the possible connection between him and your husband? And what if your husband worked for the "secret government?" And what about your father, and who he worked for? What does it all mean?

{Discussion about M}

**Q:** (Terry) Anything more about M?

**A:** Only if she asks.

**Q:** (M) What about January 26th, and why did he want me to spend the night with him?

**A:** There goes that door again!

**Q:** (Laura) Wrong door! (M) Well, I wasn't even the one who opened it, was I? (Laura) By thinking about it, and thinking there might be something to it, is opening it. We're talking about mental blocking. (Terry) You have to decide how to deal with him, because he's just one of the things, just the latest... don't let yourself alone with him, at any time. Because you don't know what he wants. I'm not just talking about murder and rape, but you don't know what his powers may be. (M) Well, he's already... no, I don't! (Terry) If he's leaching energy from you, you don't want that. Definitely, you don't want that! (Laura) You said something about her son's illness... would you care to comment on that...

**A:** Part of the attack.

**Q:** (Laura) Aside from eliminating her entirely, do they have any intentions towards her son?

**A:** Not needed.

**Q:** (Laura) What does that mean, 'not needed'?

**A:** Open.

**Q:** (Laura) They don't need any intentions because they've already done something?

**A:** Open.

**Q:** (Terry) They're not going to touch that one! That's for you ... (M) A lot of people, I sort of feel like, they eliminated me, I mean, him and I are so joined. We're very joined. It's unusual. (Laura) OK, got any more...

**A:** And if you "head for the hills," all we can say is: see you in 5th density!

**Q:** (Laura) If heading for the hills is not the solution... (Jan) Then what is?

**A:** Look within, not without!

**Q:** (Laura) Your own internal power. Mental blocking. Is that it; mental blocking, the 4th density principle?

**A:** Close.

**Q:** (Laura) Go on, dig for details. See if you can get some details. (M) What can I say, I don't even know how to word it... Across the street, what did they have to do with any of this, I'm wondering? (Laura) They already told you that... secret government connections... Greenbaum connections...(M) Across the street? (Laura) The woman... they mentioned her in connection with your husband, in connection with the guy Randy, in connection with your father, in connection with the guy... So, I mean, when you ask about the January 26th, you're asking about something about a secret government guy who's messing with your mind, so it's... there's not even any point in asking about it. Know that already, and just block it. (M) Don't speak to him, basically. I know that... (M) Other 4th density people recognize 4th density people, am I correct?

**A:** Sometimes.

**Q:** (Laura) Sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't. If they're incarnated in physical bodies, they may not, until they're awake. But, 4th density to 4th density, no...

**A:** No, what are you talking about.

**Q:** (Laura) Oh, that's what they meant. Their question mark meant what are you talking about? 4th density people recognize other 4th density people. (Terry) Just keep elaborating... (M) Well, this dude comes on with a lot of capabilities, a lot of similar things that I have. (Laura) It doesn't mean he's a 4th density person... (M) No... (Laura) No, it means he was programmed to make it look that way. How do you know you've got these abilities? Ok, you know you've heard something... (M) I've seen him at work... and I want to know; is he 4th density?

**A:** Open.

**Q:** (Laura) In other words, could be... Yes, he has that different frequency... (M) He feels different, and mental blocking angers him. (Laura) It doesn't matter. It's all on 4th density... (Terry) If mental blocking him angers him, then you know something... (M) Yes, but I don't know if I'll be happy with what I'll know... (Laura) Weel it dosen;t matter, because he can't hurt you, because your mental blocking will prevent it.

**A:** Why do you care?

**Q:** (Laura) He can't do anything. Can't you understand? The mental blocking stops them! (Terry) It throws them. They're programmed. You throw them something they're not programmed for, they don't know what to do. This guy we ran into in Las Vegas was up to... making not-so-veiled threats. When the shield went up, and... (Laura) Tell them what you said to the guy. (Terry) Something along the lines of: 'Hey, we don't have a problem here, do we?' The shield went up, although I didn't know it, and I was looking at him, and I said, 'Hey, we got a problem here?' And we glared at each other. (Laura) Yes, he glared at him with his eyes. Have we got a problem here? (Terry) 'Do we have... I don't think we have...' and this guy glared back, and we glared for about 30 seconds, and all of a sudden, he backed down, and I could see in his eyes, this confusion. All of a sudden, he shook his head, he didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to say. If it was a Vegas mobster, he'd have been waiting somewhere and probably blown us both away. That's what they do out there. This was way beyond weird Vegas mobster people. And this guy would have been low-level muscle. (M) Well, I've alredy done things to get him to leave. I've done things, and he gets up and gets confused, and doesn't know what to say, and goes... (Terry) You see! Confusion! That's it! They don't know what to do. Because they're not programmed to do that. (Jan) They're only programmed for certain responses. (Terry) As long as you respond according to program, they continue. If you don't respond the way they expect... Now, this isn't all of them! This is just the programmed people. (Laura) According to their wishful thinking...(Terry) Just like reding in the literature about the grays. That the grays do their thing, and if you do something weird, they get confused. They don't know what to do; it's outside of their program. (M) He's telling me these things, and you try to be nice, and I'm not going to do any of these things with him, and I'm listening to him; 'Oh, yes, uhhuh, yeah', and I'm going through all that, but there's no way I would do any of the things like that. (Laura) Well, let's ask them. What does he want from her?

**A:** Why do you care?

**Q:** (Laura) Why do you care, if you know what he is and what he's doing, what does it matter what he wants? (M) Why? (Jan) So, does it matter? (M) It doesn't matter... (Terry) You're curious, and that's the first step to giving permission. Don't...

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Terry) It doesn't matter. I don't care what that guy in Vegas thought or wanted. He's gone. That's all I care about. (Laura) You're curious about the negative. Don't even be curious. (Terry) Don't care. We were out of that hotel so fast when he left... Well, he didn't leave, we left. He was still sitting there, and I got up and... I'm pulling her behind me, we're zig-zagging through the slot machines, through this whole casino, in and out of the rows, up and down, back and forth, going back towards the exit. I took her deep into the casino and back out again. I'm looking to make sure. And the first turn we made, I looked back, and he wasn't at the bar any more. He got up and left, or was gone like seconds after we got up and left. We hit that door, and I gave the doorman about ten bucks to get us a cab now, and get us the h**l out of here. I don't care what he wanted, anything like that. Don't... that's the first thing, curiosity... You know the old saying, curiosity killed the cat... (M) If you run them out, and you never know, ok, and say, 'They're gone!' you're still going to be curious why. You know you got rid of them, but you always wonder, in the back of your mind, why... I mean, I do! (Jan) Well, there are some things it's best not to know!

**A:** Opens another door.

**Q:** (Terry) All you've got to know... (Laura) We're talking about mental stuff... (Terry) All you've got to know when you've gotten rid of one of them is that they had a purpose, and that you stopped them,and then get outta there! (M) Mind blocks. What kind of mind blocks? (Laura) The first thing is awareness...

**A:** Specific.

**Q:** (Laura) Specific... in other words, specific to the person? (M) Yes! (Laura) Specific to the event? (M) Specific to the energy? (Laura) And, in other words, being aware, all the time, is this correct? Being aware at all times who is, and who is not being used against you?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (Laura) And, when somebody... Even if, even if...

**A:** Learn the signs.

**Q:** (Laura) Learn the signs... that people give off when they're being used as portals, or by 4th density. They may not be a 4th density being, but anybody can be a door... at any time. Anybody. And when you learn the signs, and when you learn the behaviors, and these are not like it's written in a book... They need to be specific to your life. (Terry) Go with... follow what your essence of who you are tells you to do. (M) So, most of the people that I'm around, not necessarily the people in this room, but, most of the people I'm around right now, are doors?

**A:** Well, learn the signs, and you don't have to ask that.

**Q:** (Laura) OK, what are the signs? We've kind of learned by hard experience, but could you kind of boil them down into... (Terry) That's probably how you learn, by hard experience... (Laura) Yes, because it's like... yes. OK, but go ahead... (Terry) You've got to... I don't think they're going to answer that one. (M) Is there any big, basic signs? Anything basic, or like a... (Laura) A commonality... (Terry) You just got a basic sign from this guy... you picked up strange energy. That's a biggie right there.

**A:** No, just realize that if it does not fit, do not wear it.

**Q:** (Terry) That's right. The signs can be anything. (M) Right... (Terry) My sign, the first sign with the guy with the Camaro, he popped the hood and there was no steam.

{Break}

**Q:** (Terry) Ask if there's anything else for M. She has to ask.

**A:** No. Tell Ark that we strongly suggest that he drop Tel Aviv from his itinerary. There is a grave aura of danger over the locator of Israel. Something big, big, big is going to happen there. We can not say exactly "when", and will not say exactly what, but it will be decidedly negative!!!!

{Ensuing discussion was lost because the tape was turned off and not turned on until after this question was asked.}

**Q:** ... all right, how do we phrase this question... if every decision splits... (Terry) Now, they heard the question, let them answer. Or, what's the commentary?

**A:** Close.

**Q:** (Terry) Well, that's a one-word answer! (Laura) Yeah, you guys cheated! (Terry) That's what they said; infinite. Infinite is infinite. (Laura) Then, I had an idea that when we think hard, meditate and make conscious choice, then more universe is created along this path, than along the other. I've said it... so that you're balancing the good universe choice creations, making more of them, than there are of the mindless, thoughtless, just choosing because you don't know any better... (Terry) Well, isn't that what the lizards are doing? (Laura) Yes, it is... (Terry) They're manipulating it to make negative. But, they can never make more than there is, more negative than positive, because the universe is constantly seeking balance. So, every place they make a negative, there's some place else that becomes a positive. You can never make more. You can try.

**A:** True.

**Q:** (Terry) Although, they're working on the false premise that they can do this. (Laura) 'Wishful thinking.'

**A:** No, they are working on that false premise that they can seal realms into "4th" density and 3rd, 2nd, 1st STS for eternity.

{Ensuing discussion was lost because the tape was turned off and not turned on until after this question was asked.}

**A:** No, not physicality through all densities, just 4th through 1st density STS.

**Q:** (Laura) Ohhh!! (Terry) They don't care if it's physical or not. They're in 4th. They just want to seal them off and keep them STS to feed off of them. (Jan) Ohhh, they want their own little garden! They want their own little 'suck'garden.

**A:** "Eternity" is the key word there. It is where the wishful thinking comes into play.

**Q:** (Terry) Any more? (Laura) Eternity. In other words... in other words... (Terry) Well, there's no such thing as eternity. (Laura) Well, yes, there's eternity, but there's no 'time.' (Terry) Time isn't anything. (Laura) No, it's not. Anything further you'd like to tell Ark?

**A:** First, communicate to him.

**Q:** (Laura) All right. I'll tell him. Let's shut down here... (Terry) Wait, we have to ask about the other person that's in grave danger, was it JW? (Laura) Oh, right. Ask the question. (Terry) Who is the second person that is in grave danger that you alluded to?

**A:** It is not that he is in grave danger. It is that he has been badly misled.

**Q:** (Laura) OK, she was the one who was in grave danger, and he was the one who has been badly misled. OK. (Alice) Who? Ark? (Laura) No, JW. (Terry) Well, we don't know that. Who is this?

**A:** JW.

{JW was an individual who was totally convinced in the Nibiru/Annunaki scenario as promoted by Sitchin. You could even say he was Sitchin's biggest fan.}

**Q:** (Terry) OK, is there anything that you want to tell him? (Laura) Ha! Don't even try! (Jan) How would you begin? (Terry) No, no,no,no! Let's see, is there anything that you would tell him?

**A:** No.

**Q:** (Terry) Is there anything that he can do that he can do to get out of being misled? (Laura) It's choice!

**A:** Choice.

**Q:** (Laura) It's his choice to be misled. You choose to believe what's the physical reality that you believe in, or you choose to believe the ethereal reality by faith, it's his choice. (Terry) Well, I got by what you said originally that he could come to harm here very shortly.

**A:** Maybe.

**Q:** (Terry) Is he in the same kind of danger that M is in?

**A:** A little beyond that.

**Q:** (Terry) So, that's pretty bad! (Jan) Yes, I guess!

**A:** Open.

**Q:** (Laura) Well, the bad thing about it is, I'm even wondering if they mean totally eliminated in physical terms, because what they are really trying to do is to get a person, even if it's under deception, to make a choice for their side, so that they can accrue their energy. I mean, it's like the currency, each person they collect to, you know, go with their propaganda, becomes a soul in their pocket... so to speak. And J, I'd have to say, is perilously close to making that choice. Because he is so firmly into the 3rd density reality. I mean, he can't even let go of the Nephilim, and the Annunaki being on the planet Nibiru, and being strictly physical overlords and masters, that evolved, and blah blah blah. (Terry) Well, they aren't going to leave him here when they... (Laura) Is this the primary issue here; that it is really a war for souls?

**A:** Best way to get souls is to remove bodies.

**Q:** (Laura) So, if they get souls... (Terry) Is J dealing with somebody he should be really careful of?

**A:** Quite a few, actually.

**Q:** (Terry) Is it still on the level of the in-your-face attack?

**A:** All sorts.

**Q:** (Terry) What does J need to do? (Laura) Well, they're not going to tell you that...

**A:** Purge and begin anew.

**Q:** (Laura) What are you going to do? Call him up and tell him about this? Do you think he'd listen? (Terry) No, I was going to let you tell him the next time he calls. Tell him, listen up J, this is what the C's said... (Laura) Ha! (Terry) ... and, you know, deal with it! (Laura) I'll be the one in grave danger then! (Terry) No, tell him, you're perilously close to a big disaster, deal with it!

**A:** We suggest you forget about that!! No kidding!!!

**Q:** (Terry) Well, I thought we could help him one more time! (Laura) Is there anything else? It's late, and we need to close this up.

**A:** Ok. Goodbye.
