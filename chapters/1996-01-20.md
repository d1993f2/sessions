Frank, Laura, PZ, PkZ, SZ, SV, MM, Wilma

**Q:** (L) Hello. We have a lot of guests tonight!

**A:** Hello. No need to direct traffic.

**Q:** (L) What name shall we use tonight?

**A:** Yodnor.

**Q:** (L) And where do you transmit from?

**A:** Cassiopaea.

**Q:** (L) MM is here tonight with her aura camera. Is it possible to take a picture of us while channeling, and will anything show up?

**A:** Try it and see.

**Q:** (L) We certainly will, but we want to ask a question before we get started on that. There are rumors out that Betelgeuse has gone supernova and it can be seen with a telescope, but not yet with the naked eye. When did this occur?

**A:** You better check the data.

**Q:** (L) Okay. Is this going to have any effect on us?

**A:** No.

**Q:** (L) Is it going to have any effect on us in an ethereal sense?

**A:** No.

**Q:** (L) Is it just something that has happened that is going to be interesting to look at?

**A:** Open.

**Q:** (L) We are going to take a little break and let MM set up the camera. {Camera is set up, metal plates are arranged so that L puts right hand on one and F puts left hand on one, and their other hands are kept on the planchette.} (L) Hi, guys! What do you think of all this equipment?

**A:** Yes, neat!

**Q:** {Preparations being made for aura photos. L and F draped in black cloth.} (S) Laura, you have something stuck in your hair! (F) It's a pen. (S) She's always got things stuck in her hair. No telling what else is in there! (P) Yeah. It's pretty wild tonight. You look like a witch! (L) Well, you people are so nice tonight!

**A:** Which?

**Q:** {Laughter.} (L) Okay, everybody... settle down! We had some plans for questions tonight.

**A:** Okay.

**Q:** (L) Yes, does anybody remember the questions? Where is the list? W, ask a question because I just went blank! {Laughter}

**A:** Ask W. {Laughter}

**Q:** (L) We were curious as to what was photographed by MM and S when they were in Central America? There was some fuzzy image on the photo. Chichen Itza, I believe.

**A:** Aural imprints.

**Q:** (L) Of what? {Aura photo taken of F}

**A:** Representations in zero space/time of members of "Quan" sect of supreme spiritualists who vacated the body simultaneously.

**Q:** (W) Well, I am just coming in in the middle and I don't know what has been asked before. Who is the most likely candidate to be elected president this year?

**A:** Well, this is not of great importance, as the president does not make the decisions, but it is likely to be Dole, as the points are aligning now. But, there is a lot to be seen between now and then. Future is open.

**Q:** (MM) Let me move the camera around, I want to get one of L now. (S) Look at F's photo. It looks like there is a hand around his arm! (F) It doesn't look like anything to me. (MM) I am going to try to get one of the middle of the board where their hands are. (L) Guys! Are you here and ready for a mug shot?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (MM) Take a deep breath and hold... {aura photo of L is taken} (L) {looking at aura photo of self} This is very strange, guys. How come I am not in this picture and F shows up in his? Why have I physically disappeared?

**A:** Learning builds spiritual growth, and awareness "solidifies" knowledge.

**Q:** (L) Okay, guys, smile for the camera! {Aura photo of board is taken with L's and F's fingers on planchette.} (L) Okay, but that does not explain why I disappeared.

**A:** Because the energy field enclosure was unifying you with the conduit, as is usual during channeling sessions between 3rd and 6th density level communications.

**Q:** {Photo of board develops, and geometric figure appears to sounds of amazement from group} (L) What is this geometric figure?

![a2cs.jpg](assets/images/9e2707e7c25266bf28391a0d0bd10dfa.jpg)

**A:** Was a visual representation of the conduit, indeed!!! The reason for such clear luminescence is that thought centers were clear and open in you at the moment of the photograph. In other words, there was an imbalance of energy coming from 6th density transmission point. So, what you are viewing is 100 per cent pure light energy of uncorrupted knowledge transmitted through you. This has never been seen in 3rd density ever before. You do not completely realize the ramifications of this yet, but you will. We have made history here tonight folks!!!!!

{Break while more individual aura photos are taken. When finished, MM and W pack equipment and depart. Discussion of grammar.}

**Q:** (L) I would like you to comment on our discussion on grammar. Does acquiring knowledge in a spiritual sense assist in the development of knowledge in other areas, such as communication?

**A:** Correctness in all areas, as agreed upon by convention, can only serve to help or improve or strengthen all processes.

**Q:** (P) I would like to know what I can do to improve my memory?

**A:** You have sleep disorders that are "short circuiting what would ordinarily be utterly spectacular psychic and mental abilities. When you were very young, your senses were 10 times sharper. But then, the "interferences began."

**Q:** (P) That is absolutely true. I have had a sleep problem for years. (L) Is there anything P can do to overcome this? Physically or otherwise?

**A:** Cleansing of a very intensive nature; hypnotic regression; spirit release and dietary adjustments. Also, stress inducing life circumstances of a very "ordinary" nature must all be deviated! Ordinary, in this instance, means not of an ethereal nature directly.

**Q:** (P) Well, I have taken several steps in that direction.

**A:** Some, but it is like putting a "bandaid" on a gunshot wound.

**Q:** (P) What is the implant I have made of?

**A:** Silicon based micron definitive construct.

**Q:** (P) Is this why I have this scar?

**A:** Scar is manifestation of scar in being.

**Q:** (S) I have been having some serious problems with joint pain in my fingers and I would like to know what to do to make this better because I think that taking pain pills is something that hides the symptoms and does nothing for the cause.

**A:** Not true, S, sometimes pain killers cure cause as well as symptom. This is simply reversal of therapy. The symptom dies, thus cutting off the energy flow of the causative problem. Then the root cause dies if its "fuel supply" is interrupted for an adequate duration.

**Q:** (L) Will this work on me?

**A:** You need to utilize herbal therapies and nerve or neural blocking techniques, such as self hypnosis and Reiki and acupuncture.

**Q:** (L) Well, I have been having a HORRIBLE pain in my leg that makes me unable to walk without a cane. What is causing this pain?

**A:** Tissue nodular grains passing through vascular region affected by mild thrombosis. Try nutragina and roots of water based plants such as spirulina, for starters.

**Q:** (L) Isn't neutrogina a soap? {I was assuming that "neutrogina" was what the Cs meant, but they spelled out "nutragina" which may be something else entirely.}

**A:** Base is edible and topical.

**Q:** (L) Anything else on that?

**A:** Chlorella.

**Q:** (L) Where do I get that?

**A:** Leafy green vegetables.

**Q:** (L) P has been having almost an identical pain in HER leg, is it a similar condition?

**A:** Psychological pressures register in the physical. When acute psychological pressures are evident.

**Q:** (L) (P) When is this acute pressure going to end?

**A:** Open. We recommend ginseng and guarana also for herbal remedies for displaced fatigue.

**Q:** (L) I am getting tired.

**A:** Good Night.
